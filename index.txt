	<h3>We will prepare for a game to play, for example, Angry bird. First, angry bird is a game to hit pigs, <br>also get points and stars, we wonder to make a game like that. <br>Secondly, we need to learn how to use Unity and make game on Unity. <br>
	<br>We plan to use the Unity to make a game like the Angry bird. In after 2 weeks. We will spend about half time to learn how to make it on Bilibili. <br>And we are trying to research these kind of information to help us as much as <br>We want to use this project to improve our skill that can make us do better in later learning.
